Here's a simple Fibonacci problem using C++ along with the solution, input, and output example.

Problem:
Write a C++ program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the 
ùëõ
n-th term.

Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1.
Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
Formula:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Where:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
Example:
For n = 6, the output should be:

Copy code
0 1 1 2 3 5 8
C++ Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printFibonacci(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1, nextTerm;
    
    // Handle the case when n is 0
    if (n > 0) {
        cout << a << " ";  // Print first term
    }

    // Handle the case when n is 1
    if (n > 1) {
        cout << b << " ";  // Print second term
    }

    // Loop to print remaining terms
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        nextTerm = a + b;
        cout << nextTerm << " ";
        a = b;
        b = nextTerm;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of terms: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    printFibonacci(n);
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The program takes an integer input n (the number of terms).
It initializes two variables a (0) and b (1) as the first two Fibonacci numbers.
The loop calculates the next Fibonacci number by summing the last two terms (a + b), then prints it.
The loop continues until it has printed n terms.
Example Input/Output:
Input:

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the number of terms: 6
Output:

Copy code
0 1 1 2 3 5
Edge Cases:
If n = 0, the output will be blank.
If n = 1, the output will be 0.

Here are a few more variations of Fibonacci problems along with C++ solutions.

1. Fibonacci Recursive Approach
This solution calculates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

Problem:
Write a C++ program to find the 
ùëõ
n-th Fibonacci number using recursion.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to return the nth Fibonacci number
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;  // Base case: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);  // Recursive case
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the Fibonacci term to find: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " is " << fibonacci(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The function fibonacci(n) recursively calculates the 
ùëõ
n-th Fibonacci number.
Base cases are when 
ùëõ
=
0
n=0 or 
ùëõ
=
1
n=1, where the function simply returns n.
For larger values of 
ùëõ
n, the function calls itself to calculate the sum of the two preceding numbers.
Example Input/Output:
Input:

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the Fibonacci term to find: 6
Output:

arduino
Copy code
Fibonacci number at position 6 is 8
2. Fibonacci Using Dynamic Programming (Memoization)
This approach uses dynamic programming (memoization) to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers and avoid redundant calculations.

Problem:
Write a C++ program to find the 
ùëõ
n-th Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate nth Fibonacci number using memoization
int fibonacci(int n) {
    vector<int> fib(n + 1, 0);  // Create a memoization table to store Fibonacci numbers
    
    // Base cases
    fib[0] = 0;
    fib[1] = 1;
    
    // Fill the memoization table for the rest of the terms
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
    }
    
    return fib[n];  // Return the nth Fibonacci number
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the Fibonacci term to find: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " is " << fibonacci(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
We use a vector fib[] to store Fibonacci numbers.
The first two terms are initialized (fib[0] = 0, fib[1] = 1).
The loop fills in the remaining terms using the recurrence relation, ensuring each Fibonacci number is only calculated once.
Example Input/Output:
Input:

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the Fibonacci term to find: 6
Output:

arduino
Copy code
Fibonacci number at position 6 is 8
3. Fibonacci Sequence Generator (Print First N Terms)
This C++ program prints the first n Fibonacci numbers in sequence.

Problem:
Write a C++ program to print the first n Fibonacci numbers.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printFibonacci(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1, nextTerm;
    
    // Handle case for 0
    if (n >= 1) cout << a << " ";  // Print first term
    // Handle case for 1
    if (n >= 2) cout << b << " ";  // Print second term

    // Loop to print next terms
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        nextTerm = a + b;
        cout << nextTerm << " ";
        a = b;
        b = nextTerm;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of terms: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    cout << "The first " << n << " Fibonacci numbers are: ";
    printFibonacci(n);
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The program uses a loop to print the first n Fibonacci numbers.
It starts by printing 0 and 1 (if n >= 1 and n >= 2, respectively), then continues the sequence using the formula F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).
Example Input/Output:
Input:

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the number of terms: 7
Output:

sql
Copy code
The first 7 Fibonacci numbers are: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
4. Fibonacci Using Iterative Approach (Optimized)
This is an optimized version of the Fibonacci sequence where we only store the last two numbers to save memory.

Problem:
Write a C++ program to find the 
ùëõ
n-th Fibonacci number using an optimized iterative approach.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;

    int a = 0, b = 1, nextTerm;
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        nextTerm = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = nextTerm;
    }
    
    return b;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the Fibonacci term to find: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " is " << fibonacci(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
This solution uses only two variables (a and b) to store the last two Fibonacci numbers, making it more memory-efficient.
The loop starts at 2 and calculates the Fibonacci number up to n, updating the variables a and b at each step.
Example Input/Output:
Input:

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the Fibonacci term to find: 6
Output:

arduino
Copy code
Fibonacci number at position 6 is 8
These are several common ways to solve Fibonacci problems in C++. Each approach has its own use case depending on the problem's requirements, such as recursion, dynamic programming, or iterative methods.
