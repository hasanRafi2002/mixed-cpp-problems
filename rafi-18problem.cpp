Great! Let's start with some basic problems and gradually work our way up to more advanced ones. Here's a simple problem to begin with:

Problem 1: Sum of Two Numbers
Write a C++ program that takes two integers as input and outputs their sum.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    
    // Input two integers
    cout << "Enter first number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    
    cout << "Enter second number: ";
    cin >> num2;
    
    // Output the sum
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    cout << "The sum is: " << sum << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
cin is used to take input from the user.
cout is used to display the result to the user.
The program calculates the sum of the two numbers and outputs it.
Problem 2: Find the Largest Number
Write a program to find the largest of three numbers entered by the user.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, num3;
    
    // Input three numbers
    cout << "Enter first number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    
    cout << "Enter second number: ";
    cin >> num2;
    
    cout << "Enter third number: ";
    cin >> num3;
    
    // Find the largest number
    int largest = num1;
    
    if (num2 > largest) {
        largest = num2;
    }
    
    if (num3 > largest) {
        largest = num3;
    }
    
    // Output the largest number
    cout << "The largest number is: " << largest << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
We compare the three numbers using conditional if statements.
We store the largest number in the variable largest and display it.

Great! Let's move on to a slightly more complex problem.

Problem 3: Check If a Number is Prime
Write a C++ program that checks if a number is prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPrime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) {
        return false;  // Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
    }
    
    // Check divisibility from 2 to sqrt(num)
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) {
            return false;  // Number is divisible by i, so it's not prime
        }
    }
    
    return true;  // Number is prime
}

int main() {
    int num;
    
    // Input the number
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    
    // Check if the number is prime
    if (isPrime(num)) {
        cout << num << " is a prime number." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << num << " is not a prime number." << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The function isPrime checks whether a number is prime or not by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number (this is an optimization to reduce unnecessary checks).
If any divisor is found, the number is not prime. If no divisors are found, it's prime.
Key Concepts:
Prime Numbers: Numbers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves.
Optimizing with Square Root: We don't need to check all numbers up to num - 1â€”checking up to the square root of the number is enough.
Problem 4: Fibonacci Series
Write a C++ program that prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printFibonacci(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1;
    
    if (n <= 0) {
        cout << "Enter a positive number!" << endl;
        return;
    }
    
    // Print the first n Fibonacci numbers
    cout << "Fibonacci Series: ";
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cout << a << " ";
        
        int next = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = next;
    }
    
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    
    // Input the number of Fibonacci terms to print
    cout << "Enter the number of terms: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    // Print the Fibonacci series
    printFibonacci(n);
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
The variables a and b store the last two Fibonacci numbers, and next is the sum of those two.
We print a and update the values of a and b accordingly.

Great! Let's tackle another interesting problem.

Problem 5: Reverse a Number
Write a C++ program that reverses the digits of a given number.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int reverseNumber(int num) {
    int reversed = 0;
    
    while (num != 0) {
        int digit = num % 10;  // Get the last digit
        reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;  // Add the digit to the reversed number
        num /= 10;  // Remove the last digit from the original number
    }
    
    return reversed;
}

int main() {
    int num;
    
    // Input the number
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    
    // Reverse the number and output the result
    cout << "Reversed number: " << reverseNumber(num) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The function reverseNumber takes the input number and reverses its digits.
The while loop extracts the last digit of the number using num % 10 and appends it to reversed after shifting its digits.
The number is reduced by dividing it by 10 (num /= 10) until all digits are processed.
Key Concepts:
Modulo Operation (%): Used to extract the last digit of a number.
Integer Division (/): Used to remove the last digit from the number.
Problem 6: Palindrome Check
Write a C++ program that checks if a number is a palindrome. A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPalindrome(int num) {
    int original = num;
    int reversed = 0;
    
    // Reverse the number
    while (num != 0) {
        int digit = num % 10;
        reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;
        num /= 10;
    }
    
    // Check if original and reversed numbers are the same
    return original == reversed;
}

int main() {
    int num;
    
    // Input the number
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    
    // Check if the number is a palindrome
    if (isPalindrome(num)) {
        cout << num << " is a palindrome." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << num << " is not a palindrome." << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The function isPalindrome reverses the number and checks if the original number is equal to the reversed number.
If they are equal, the number is a palindrome.
Key Concepts:
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 121, 12321).

Great! Let's dive into a more challenging problem now.

Problem 7: Find Factorial of a Number
Write a C++ program that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long long factorial(int n) {
    long long fact = 1;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fact *= i;  // Multiply fact by i
    }
    
    return fact;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    
    // Input the number
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    // Calculate and display the factorial
    if (n < 0) {
        cout << "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Factorial of " << n << " is " << factorial(n) << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The factorial function calculates the factorial by iterating from 1 to n and multiplying the result by each number in that range.
We use a long long variable to handle larger numbers, since factorials grow very quickly.
The program handles the case where the input number is negative, as factorials are only defined for non-negative integers.
Key Concepts:
Factorial: The product of all integers from 1 to n. It's commonly used in combinatorics and probability.
Overflow Consideration: Factorials grow rapidly, so we use long long to store large results.
Problem 8: Find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
Write a C++ program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find GCD using Euclidean algorithm
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;  // Set b to the remainder
        a = temp;   // Set a to the old value of b
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    
    // Input two numbers
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    
    // Find and display the GCD
    cout << "GCD of " << a << " and " << b << " is " << gcd(a, b) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The other number is the GCD.
We use a while loop to implement this process.
Key Concepts:
Euclidean Algorithm: An efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers.
Modulo Operation (%): Used to get the remainder when dividing two numbers.
These problems cover some important mathematical concepts and algorithms. Would you like to try solving one of these problems yourself, or should I continue with more exercises?

Great! Let's tackle another problem. This one will introduce you to working with arrays and sorting.

Problem 9: Sort an Array
Write a C++ program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        // Flag to check if any swapping happened
        bool swapped = false;
        
        // Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
        // Last i elements are already in place
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        
        // If no elements were swapped, the array is sorted
        if (!swapped) {
            break;
        }
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    
    // Input the number of elements
    cout << "Enter the number of elements: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    int arr[n];
    
    // Input the elements
    cout << "Enter the elements: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    
    // Sort the array using bubble sort
    bubbleSort(arr, n);
    
    // Print the sorted array
    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    printArray(arr, n);
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements of the array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The largest element "bubbles" up to the end of the array after each pass.
The swapped flag helps optimize the algorithm: if no elements were swapped during a pass, the array is already sorted, and we can stop early.
Key Concepts:
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm, though not very efficient for large arrays.
Optimization: The swapped flag helps avoid unnecessary passes through the array if it's already sorted.
Problem 10: Count Vowels and Consonants
Write a C++ program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype> // For isalpha and tolower
using namespace std;

void countVowelsAndConsonants(const string& str) {
    int vowels = 0, consonants = 0;
    
    // Traverse each character in the string
    for (char ch : str) {
        ch = tolower(ch);  // Convert to lowercase
        
        if (isalpha(ch)) {  // Only count alphabetic characters
            if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u') {
                vowels++;
            } else {
                consonants++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    cout << "Vowels: " << vowels << endl;
    cout << "Consonants: " << consonants << endl;
}

int main() {
    string str;
    
    // Input the string
    cout << "Enter a string: ";
    getline(cin, str);
    
    // Count vowels and consonants
    countVowelsAndConsonants(str);
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The function countVowelsAndConsonants traverses each character of the input string.
It converts each character to lowercase to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters uniformly.
The program checks if each character is an alphabetic letter using the isalpha function and then checks whether it's a vowel or consonant.
Key Concepts:
Character Checking: The isalpha function checks if a character is alphabetic, and tolower ensures that we handle both upper and lower case letters.
String Traversal: Using a for loop to iterate over each character in the string.
These problems cover sorting, string manipulation, and basic algorithms. Would you like to try solving one of these problems yourself, or should I continue with more exercises?

Awesome! Letâ€™s move on to a more advanced problem involving searching and algorithm efficiency.

Problem 11: Binary Search
Write a C++ program that implements Binary Search to find an element in a sorted array. Binary search is an efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides the search interval in half.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to perform binary search
int binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Calculate the middle index
        
        // Check if the target is at the middle
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;  // Return the index of the target
        }
        
        // If the target is greater, ignore the left half
        if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        // If the target is smaller, ignore the right half
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;  // Target not found
}

int main() {
    int n, target;
    
    // Input the number of elements
    cout << "Enter the number of elements: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    int arr[n];
    
    // Input the elements (sorted array)
    cout << "Enter the sorted elements: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    
    // Input the target element to search for
    cout << "Enter the target element: ";
    cin >> target;
    
    // Perform binary search
    int result = binarySearch(arr, n, target);
    
    if (result != -1) {
        cout << "Element found at index: " << result << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Element not found" << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the array in half.
If the target is smaller than the middle element, search the left half.
If the target is larger than the middle element, search the right half.
This reduces the search space by half with each step, making it much faster than linear search for large arrays.
The array must be sorted for binary search to work.
Key Concepts:
Efficiency: Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much faster than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets.
Middle Index Calculation: To avoid overflow, we calculate mid as left + (right - left) / 2 instead of (left + right) / 2.
Problem 12: Merge Two Sorted Arrays
Write a C++ program that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void mergeArrays(int arr1[], int n1, int arr2[], int n2, int merged[]) {
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    
    // Merge both arrays into merged[]
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
            merged[k++] = arr1[i++];
        } else {
            merged[k++] = arr2[j++];
        }
    }
    
    // If there are remaining elements in arr1
    while (i < n1) {
        merged[k++] = arr1[i++];
    }
    
    // If there are remaining elements in arr2
    while (j < n2) {
        merged[k++] = arr2[j++];
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n1, n2;
    
    // Input the size of first array
    cout << "Enter size of first array: ";
    cin >> n1;
    int arr1[n1];
    
    // Input elements for first array
    cout << "Enter elements of first sorted array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
        cin >> arr1[i];
    }
    
    // Input the size of second array
    cout << "Enter size of second array: ";
    cin >> n2;
    int arr2[n2];
    
    // Input elements for second array
    cout << "Enter elements of second sorted array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
        cin >> arr2[i];
    }
    
    // Merge both arrays
    int merged[n1 + n2];
    mergeArrays(arr1, n1, arr2, n2, merged);
    
    // Print merged array
    cout << "Merged sorted array: ";
    printArray(merged, n1 + n2);
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
This program takes two sorted arrays and merges them into one sorted array using a two-pointer approach.
It compares elements from both arrays (arr1 and arr2) and adds the smaller element to the merged array (merged).
After one of the arrays is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other array are directly added to the merged array.
Key Concepts:
Two-pointer technique: It uses two pointers to traverse both arrays, ensuring that elements are added to the merged array in sorted order.
Merge Process: This is the basis for merge sort, an efficient sorting algorithm.
These problems cover searching, merging arrays, and algorithm optimization. Would you like to try solving one of these problems yourself, or should I continue with more advanced topics?

You're doing great! Let's move to a more advanced topic, involving dynamic programming, which is commonly used to solve problems efficiently by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

Problem 13: Fibonacci Using Dynamic Programming (Memoization)
Write a C++ program to compute the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate nth Fibonacci number using memoization
int fibonacci(int n, vector<int>& memo) {
    // If the value has already been computed, return it
    if (memo[n] != -1) {
        return memo[n];
    }
    
    // Compute the nth Fibonacci number using the formula
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    
    // Store the result in memoization array and return it
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    
    // Input the value of n
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    // Create a memoization array initialized to -1
    vector<int> memo(n + 1, -1);
    
    // Get the nth Fibonacci number using memoization
    cout << "The " << n << "th Fibonacci number is: " << fibonacci(n, memo) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Memoization: The memo array stores the Fibonacci values that have already been computed. If we need a value that has already been computed, we simply return it instead of recalculating.
This reduces the time complexity of the Fibonacci computation from exponential to linear (O(n)).
Key Concepts:
Dynamic Programming: This is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their results to avoid redundant computations.
Memoization: A specific form of dynamic programming where we store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.
Problem 14: Knapsack Problem (0/1 Knapsack)
The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic example of dynamic programming. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by putting some of the items in a knapsack without exceeding the knapsack's weight limit.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming
int knapsack(int W, vector<int>& weights, vector<int>& values, int n) {
    // Create a DP table to store the maximum value for each subproblem
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));
    
    // Fill the DP table
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= W; w++) {
            if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                // Take the maximum of including or excluding the item
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] + values[i - 1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Return the maximum value that can be obtained for weight W
    return dp[n][W];
}

int main() {
    int n, W;
    
    // Input the number of items and the weight limit of the knapsack
    cout << "Enter the number of items: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    cout << "Enter the weight limit of the knapsack: ";
    cin >> W;
    
    vector<int> weights(n), values(n);
    
    // Input the weights and values of the items
    cout << "Enter the weights of the items: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> weights[i];
    }
    
    cout << "Enter the values of the items: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> values[i];
    }
    
    // Get the maximum value that can be obtained
    cout << "Maximum value in knapsack = " << knapsack(W, weights, values, n) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
0/1 Knapsack Problem: For each item, we decide whether to include it in the knapsack or exclude it. This is based on whether including the item results in a greater value than excluding it, while ensuring that the weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity.
Dynamic Programming Table (DP): The 2D DP table stores the maximum value that can be obtained for each weight limit and number of items.
The dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be achieved with the first i items and weight limit w.
Key Concepts:
Dynamic Programming (DP): A technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems.
Knapsack Problem: A classic problem in combinatorics and optimization, used to demonstrate dynamic programming.
Problem 15: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem involves finding the longest subsequence common to two sequences. It is a common problem in bioinformatics, text comparison, and other areas.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the length of the LCS using dynamic programming
int lcs(string X, string Y) {
    int m = X.length();
    int n = Y.length();
    
    // Create a DP table to store the lengths of longest common subsequences
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    
    // Fill the DP table
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;  // If characters match
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);  // Take the maximum of excluding one character
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Return the length of the longest common subsequence
    return dp[m][n];
}

int main() {
    string X, Y;
    
    // Input the two strings
    cout << "Enter first string: ";
    cin >> X;
    
    cout << "Enter second string: ";
    cin >> Y;
    
    // Find and print the length of the LCS
    cout << "Length of Longest Common Subsequence: " << lcs(X, Y) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The LCS problem finds the longest subsequence common to both strings. It does not require the characters to be contiguous, but they must appear in the same order.
We use dynamic programming to fill a 2D DP table, where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS of the first i characters of string X and the first j characters of string Y.
Key Concepts:
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): The longest subsequence that appears in both sequences in the same order.
Dynamic Programming (DP): The table stores the results of smaller subproblems to build up to the final solution.
These problems introduce dynamic programming, which is a powerful method to solve optimization problems efficiently. Would you like to try solving one of these problems yourself, or should I continue with more advanced topics?

You're doing great! Letâ€™s dive into some more advanced problem-solving topics, this time involving graph algorithms, which are widely used in computer science and real-world applications like networking, routing, and social network analysis.

Problem 16: Depth-First Search (DFS) on a Graph
Write a C++ program that implements Depth-First Search (DFS) on an undirected graph. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
    // Mark the node as visited
    visited[node] = true;
    cout << node << " ";  // Print the node (visited)

    // Visit all the neighbors of the node
    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dfs(neighbor, adj, visited);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    
    // Input the number of nodes and edges
    cout << "Enter the number of nodes: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Enter the number of edges: ";
    cin >> m;
    
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);  // Adjacency list representation
    
    // Input the edges
    cout << "Enter the edges (node1 node2):" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);  // Since the graph is undirected
    }

    vector<bool> visited(n, false);  // Array to track visited nodes
    
    // Perform DFS starting from node 0 (you can change the start node)
    cout << "DFS Traversal: ";
    dfs(0, adj, visited);
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
DFS Traversal: The DFS algorithm starts from a given node and explores as deeply as possible into each branch of the graph before backtracking.
Adjacency List: We represent the graph as an adjacency list (adj) where each node points to a list of its neighbors.
Visited Array: This is used to track which nodes have already been visited to avoid cycles or redundant exploration.
Recursive DFS: The dfs function is called recursively for each unvisited neighbor of the current node.
Key Concepts:
Graph Representation: Graphs can be represented in different ways, such as adjacency matrix, adjacency list, etc. Here, we used an adjacency list for efficient space usage and faster neighbor lookups.
Depth-First Search: A fundamental algorithm for graph traversal, useful in applications like pathfinding, solving mazes, etc.
Problem 17: Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a Graph
Write a C++ program that implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) on an undirected graph. BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving on to their neighbors.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

void bfs(int start, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
    queue<int> q;
    visited[start] = true;
    q.push(start);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        cout << node << " ";  // Print the node

        // Visit all neighbors of the current node
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    
    // Input the number of nodes and edges
    cout << "Enter the number of nodes: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Enter the number of edges: ";
    cin >> m;
    
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);  // Adjacency list representation
    
    // Input the edges
    cout << "Enter the edges (node1 node2):" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);  // Since the graph is undirected
    }

    vector<bool> visited(n, false);  // Array to track visited nodes
    
    // Perform BFS starting from node 0 (you can change the start node)
    cout << "BFS Traversal: ";
    bfs(0, adj, visited);
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
BFS Traversal: The BFS algorithm starts from a given node, explores all its neighbors, then explores their neighbors, and so on. Itâ€™s a level-order traversal.
Queue: BFS uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit next, ensuring that nodes are processed level by level.
Visited Array: Similar to DFS, this is used to track which nodes have already been visited.
Key Concepts:
Breadth-First Search: An algorithm for graph traversal that explores all neighbors of a node before moving on to their neighbors. Itâ€™s particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
Queue: A queue is used to manage the order in which nodes are processed.
Problem 18: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Shortest Path)
Write a C++ program that implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted, directed graph.

Solution:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

// Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph
void dijkstra(int source, vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& adj, vector<int>& dist) {
    int n = adj.size();
    
    // Min-heap (priority queue) to store (distance, node) pairs
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    pq.push({0, source});  // Distance to source is 0
    dist[source] = 0;
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int u = pq.top().second;  // Current node
        int d = pq.top().first;   // Current distance to node
        pq.pop();

        // If the distance is outdated (i.e., a shorter path has already been found), skip it
        if (d > dist[u]) {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Explore all neighbors of the current node
        for (auto& neighbor : adj[u]) {
            int v = neighbor.first;
            int weight = neighbor.second;
            
            // If a shorter path to v is found
            if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                pq.push({dist[v], v});  // Push the updated distance and node to the priority queue
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    
    // Input the number of nodes and edges
    cout << "Enter the number of nodes: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Enter the number of edges: ";
    cin >> m;
    
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);  // Adjacency list representation (node, weight)
    
    // Input the edges
    cout << "Enter the edges (node1 node2 weight):" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u, v, w;
        cin >> u >> v >> w;
        adj[u].push_back({v, w});
    }

    vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);  // Distance array initialized to infinity
    
    // Run Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm starting from node 0 (you can change the start node)
    dijkstra(0, adj, dist);
    
    // Output the shortest distances from source to all other nodes
    cout << "Shortest distances from source (node 0):" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dist[i] == INT_MAX) {
            cout << "Node " << i << ": Unreachable" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Node " << i << ": " << dist[i] << endl;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: This algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
Priority Queue (Min-Heap): A priority queue is used to always expand the node with the currently known shortest distance.
Distance Array: The dist array keeps track of the shortest distance from the source node to each other node in the graph.
Key Concepts:
Shortest Path Algorithm: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is widely used to find the shortest path in graphs with non-negative edge weights.
Priority Queue: Used to efficiently get the node with the smallest distance at each step.
These problems cover graph traversal algorithms like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Would you like to try implementing one of these, or would you prefer to continue with more advanced topics or new types of problems?
